## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Major content and visual update to the MycoStack website:

**Content:**
- Commons Stack elevated to primary root of the MycoStack
- P2P Foundation reframed as both foundation and forward-looking knowledge engine (convivial knowledge packets → open source protocol toolkits for P4P)
- New "Data Flows of the Commons" section covering trust, resources, favors, capital as community-manageable data flows
- Flow Funding moved to "Tools in Active Research" with TBFF (Threshold-Based Flow Funding) from rFunds.online
- Added rStack and rSpace links for community-owned infrastructure
- Updated hero lineage text, network map nodes, and footer links

**Visual:**
- Lighter starting background (warm twilight instead of pitch black)
- Reduced chroma across color stops for gentler rainbow fade
- Interactive mycelial canvas: mouse/touch cursor attraction, spore particles, hypha connection lines, ambient glow
- Slower trail fade for more persistent mycelial trails
